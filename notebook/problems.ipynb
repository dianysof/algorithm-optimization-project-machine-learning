The system has the ability to add books to the library, lend books to readers, and receive books back. In addition, it can also list all the books available in the library.\n","\n","The problem is that the system is very slow and needs to be optimized. Your task is to analyze the code, identify areas of improvement and rewrite parts of the code to make it more efficient. Specifically, you are asked to perform the following improvements (update the below code and implement the following points):\n","\n","1. Identify and improve the data structures used to store books in the library and borrowed books. *Hint: Use an `set` instead of a `list` to store books in `Library.books` and `Library.borrowed_books` to make it more efficient to check if a book is present.**\n","\n","2. Avoid errors that could occur when attempting to borrow or return a book that is not present. *Hint: Use the `set.discard()` method instead of `list.remove()` in `Library.borrow_book()` and `Library.return_book()` to avoid errors if the book is not present.*\n","\n","3. Improve the efficiency of selecting a random book to lend or return. *Hint: Instead of selecting a random book from `Library.books` or `Library.borrowed_books` by indexing (which involves a conversion to list which is expensive), you can convert these sets to lists only once before the cycle.*\n","\n","4. Improve the efficiency of the function that lists all the books available in the library. *Hint: Instead of printing each book one by one in `Library.list_books()`, you can construct a complete string with all book titles and then print that string once.*\n","\n","5. Avoid repeated calls to `len()` in the body of loops.\n","\n","6. Use list comprehension to improve efficiency of book creation.. *Hint: Use list comprehension for book creation, which can be faster than using a for loop and repeatedly calling `Library.add_book()`.*\n","\n","7. Optimize checking the availability of borrowed books before attempting to return them. *Hint: Avoid checking `if library.borrowed_books:` before attempting to return a book. If you use sets and the `discard()` method, there is no need for this check.*"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"21bcb8c4","metadata":{},"source":["#### Read and update the following given code:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"8467465b","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import random\n","import time\n","\n","class Book:\n","    def __init__(self, id, title, author, pages):\n","        self.id = id\n","        self.title = title\n","        self.author = author\n","        self.pages = pages\n","\n","class Library:\n","    def __init__(self, name):\n","        self.name = name\n","        self.books = {}\n","        self.borrowed_books = {}\n","\n","    def add_book(self, book):\n","        self.books[book.id] = book\n","\n","    def borrow_book(self, book_id):\n","        book = self.books.pop(book_id, None)\n","        if book:\n","            self.borrowed_books[book.id] = book\n","\n","    def return_book(self, book_id):\n","        book = self.borrowed_books.pop(book_id, None)\n","        if book:\n","            self.books[book.id] = book\n","\n","    def list_books(self):\n","        return \"\\n\".join(book.title for book in self.books.values())\n","\n","\n","# Create a library\n","library = Library(\"Codeville\")\n","\n","# Add some books\n","library.books = {i: Book(i, f\"Book {i}\", f\"Author {i}\", i*10) for i in range(1, 101)}\n","\n","# Borrow some books\n","for _ in range(50):\n","    book_id_to_borrow = random.choice(list(library.books.keys()))\n","    library.borrow_book(book_id_to_borrow)\n","\n","# Return some books\n","for _ in range(25):\n","    if library.borrowed_books:  # Check if there are books to return\n","        book_id_to_return = random.choice(list(library.borrowed_books.keys()))\n","        library.return_book(book_id_to_return)\n","\n","# List all the books\n","start_time = time.time()\n","print(library.list_books())\n","end_time = time.time()\n","\n","print(f\"Listing took {end_time - start_time} seconds\")"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"011996bc","metadata":{},"source":["## Exercise 2: Task Management System Optimization\n","\n","You are provided with code that simulates a task management system.

Your task is to analyze the code, identify areas that could be improved, and rewrite parts of the code to make it more efficient. Specifically, you are asked to perform the following tasks:\n","\n","1. Identify and improve the data structures used to store the tasks. *Hint: Use an `set` or `dict` instead of a `list` to store tasks in `TaskManager`, to make checking for the existence of a task more efficient.*\n","\n","2. Avoid checking whether a task is in the task list each time a task is completed. *Hint: Avoid checking for the existence of a task in `TaskManager.complete_task()`. If you are sure that the task comes from `TaskManager.tasks`, it is not necessary to check if it is in the list.*\n","\n","3. Restructure the way task status is tracked. *Hint: Instead of marking a task as completed by modifying its `is_done` attribute, you may consider having two sets or lists in `TaskManager`: one for pending tasks and one for completed tasks.*\n","\n","4. Use list comprehension to improve the efficiency of task creation. *Hint: Use a list comprehension for task creation, which may be faster than using a for loop and repeatedly calling `TaskManager.add_task()`.*\n","\n","5.

This can make it easier to find and manage tasks.*\n","\n","7. Avoid repeated calls to the same function or method in a loop. *Hint: Avoid repeatedly calling the same function or method in a loop, such as `TaskManager.add_task()` or `TaskManager.complete_task()`.*\n","\n","8. Avoid repetition of code when calculating the status of a task. *Hint: Avoid code repetition. In `TaskManager.list_tasks()`, the task status is calculated the same way for each task.
